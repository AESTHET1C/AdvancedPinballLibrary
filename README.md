# Trinket Pinball
### Trinket Pro Library for EWM Arduino camp
Eli Baum, 2016

This libary serves to simplify many of the common tasks that campers will use to control their pinball games. The intention is to allow users to learn useful concepts without getting bogged down with the technicalities of the Arduino system.

## Installation
Download this repository as a zip and rename the folder `ewm`. Then move that folder into your Arduino sketchbook's `libraries` folder. To use in a sketch, select the library from **Sketch** > **Include Library**.

## API
The pinball API includes functions for controlling the speaker, DC motor, servo motor, 7-segment displays, and internal EEPROM. Most campers should needn't stray too far from this functionality.
