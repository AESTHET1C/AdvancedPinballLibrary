# Trinket Pinball
## Trinket Pro Library for EWM Arduino camp
Eli Baum, 2016

This libary serves to simplify many of the common tasks that campers will use to control their pinball games. The intention is to allow users to learn useful concepts without getting bogged down with the technicalities of the Arduino system.
